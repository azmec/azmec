### Hi there :wave:, I'm Aldats!

I am `@Aldats`, a Computer Science undergraduate exploring digital, interactive
solutions in education of all demographics. I am currently investigating the
issue of embedded, stealth assessment in existing educational games and
demonstrating the achievement of learning goals for a prospective undergraduate
thesis. At other opportunities, I enjoy building learning tools, software, and
games in C, C++, Zig, and Lua.

I host additional projects on _Sourcehut_, an alternative source forge, at
<https://sr.ht/~aldats/>.
