### Hi there :wave:, I'm Aldats!

I am `@Aldats`, a Computer Science undergraduate exploring digital, interactive
solutions in education of all demographics. I am interested in conducting research 
regarding computing education, conceptual change in sciene education, and
technology-mediated learning enviornments. I am currently exploring these interests
in an undergraduate thesis investigating the concepts and strategies novice computer
science students enter introductory programming classrooms with and the ways they
support expert-level competency. At other opportunities, I enjoy building learning
tools, software, and games in C, C++, Zig, and Lua.

I host additional projects on _Sourcehut_, an alternative source forge, at
<https://sr.ht/~aldats/>.
