# Hi! 👋
I'm a 17-year old games developer from the U.S., hoping to develop, legitimize, and normalize interactive media for educational purposes. I primarily develop in Godot and LOVE2D, but am always exploring other frameworks and languages. Currently, I'm developing what I call *burner* projects in Godot and LOVE2D, which are just projects meant to show me the ropes of particular systems and ideas, the first and foremost of which is LITARGIE and LUAORYX.

# What I'm Currently Learning 📖
- GDScript
- Lua
- C#
- C++
- Pedalogical Psychology 
- Educational applications of Sociology

# Current Goals 🔴
- Major in Computer Science and Applications
- Minor in Sociology
- Completion of LITARGIE
- Vast amounts of reading

# Where to Find Me 🔍
- Nowhere else!
